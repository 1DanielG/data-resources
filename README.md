# Data resources

### A list of helpful links and code for R, SQL, Python, HTML/CSS, etc. 

If you know of a good resource that you want to share, feel free to submit a pull request! If you're not sure how to do that, you can also submit an issue with the link to the resource and a quick intro to why it's helpful for you. 

This doc is based on my [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dN9eeNJNaDIInpn7RCuigNL5NeBVkTFJxFtj8CkTW2g/edit?usp=sharing) of resources. I'm slowly working on coverting that file!
